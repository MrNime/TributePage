                <p class="mb-0">The rear tire is 1-2mm away from the rumble strips, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that's not on accident because top tier guys can do that. I heard a story from Pat Symmonds about a very young Brazilian rookie for Toleman F1. I forgot what race but it was a street circuit and the young Brazilian crashed out shortly after a yellow. Upset, he was adamant it was not his fault and it was the wall that moved.
                    Obviously they wrote him off but this angered the rookie more. After the race they decided to show the youngster that he's an idiot and Pat walked with him over to the wall that he hit to show him it didn't move.
                    The yellow before the crash? That was at that barrier and the crash indeed moved the wall. Twisted it and there was only a few centimeters sticking out where there wasn't before.
                    That's what Ayrton Senna hit. Pat knew the kid was special but that was something else.</p>
